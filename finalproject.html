			<summary>My Childhood</summary>
			<div>My earliest childhood memory is of the first time I met my mother in person when I was four. A beautiful woman whose personality seemed to glow from her. I had seen a picture of her before then I was told by Mummy Dada, my aunt, so I knew her on sight. The woman I saw walk in the room as I watched from my grandfatherâ€™s lap seemed effervescent. She floated from person to person at the family reunion like an angel.</div>
